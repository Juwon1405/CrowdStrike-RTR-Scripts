# CrowdStrike-RTR-Scripts

The following scripts are for the CrowdStrike Real-Time Response capability, as they still lack a proper "store" to share across their customers.
If there are any issues with these, please raise an issue and I will try and get to them as soon as I can. Do note that CS does have system and software requirements. Be sure you meet these before posting your issue.
